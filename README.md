## Ceaser Cipher
Ceaser Ciper is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.</br>
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</br>
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.</br>
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</br>
